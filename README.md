# Facial-Landmark-based-BMI-Analysis
## Datasets
- The dataset we used comes from two previous studies, namely the [VIP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8546159) dataset and the [VB](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8666768) dataset.
## Example
- We provided a image as an example in src/example and demonstrated the entire process in the main.py.
- You can also use the saved model to subtract the time for reading data and training, we only provided the SVR_lm_BMI.pkl and demonstrated it in main.py.
